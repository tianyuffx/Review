# passge1: Success in life

Success means different things for different people.Some may equate it with fame.some with wealth and still some with accomplishments.
For me. it means fulfilling one's dreams.Whatever your dreams are,you have a goal there and then focus all your attention on it.

Dreams bring you hope and happiness.In the procee of stuggling for it,you cry,sweat,complain or evne curse,but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and trouble.So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

There are several keys to success.First,your goal must be practical and practicable.If you set your goal too high,chances are that you will never attain it.Next,you have to make a plan of doing it.You can take some steps to realize it.Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligent,patient and persevering.

Even if you meet with sojme difficulties or frustrations,just take them in your stride.You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable.With this will and determination,success is sure to wait for you at the end of the tunnel!

# passge1: Learning: a Lifelong Career

As food is to the body,so is learning to the mind.Our bodies grow and muscles develop with the intake of food.Likewise,we should keep learning day by day to maintain our mental power and expand our intellectual capacity.

Constant learning supplies us with fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning,analysis,and judgement.Continuous learing is the best way to keep pace with the times in the information age.

It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place for the acquisition of knowledge.On the contrary,learning should be an endless process,from the cradle to the grave.With the world changing so fast,to stop learing for just a few days will make a person lag behind.

Lack of learing will inevitablylead to the stagnation of th mind,or even worse,its fossilization.Therefore,to stay mentally young,we have to take learing as a lifelong career.

# passage3: JOGGING

Every day,in all kinds of weather,thousands of men and women go jogging.Why has jogging-running slowly for long distances-become so popular?most joggers like it because they have heard it is a very good exercise.Jogging makes the heart stringer and helps people lose weight.It can also help them feel better about themselves

How fast should you go ? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you run.If you have difficulty talking,you are going too fast.How far should you jog?Remember not to go too far too soon.In fact you should walk,not run,the first few times.Then do some short jogs,but no more than what you can do comforably.

After that,increase your distance a quarter or half of a mile every two weeks or so.Maybe in a few years,you,too,can run in a marathon like thousands of other people do.

# passage4: Body language

Americans feel that physical contact can be important in breaking down barriers between people.Such physical acts as hugging,shaking hands and kissing in public are seen as displays of affection

In China, on the other hand, this is not common becaouse physical contacct is not the custom.Interestingly enough,most Chinese who spend some time in America come to like hugging;they learn that Americans use body language to express feelings.It is a way of saying "I like you and I care about you".

Shaking hands is another traditional way of greeting someone in America.Shaking hands is a more formal way of greeting than hugging.Whereas hugging shows closeness,shaking hands means that there is a little more formality in the relationship.

Western people usually shake hands when meeting someone for the first time,or when they see someone again after a certain amount of time has passed.In Japan,people tranditionally bow as a form of greeting.Other countries have different customes,like patting someone on the back or kissing.

# passage5: Sleep

Scientists suggest that tody, most adults get up to two hours' less sleep than they need.As a result,those lacking in sleep are forgetful,tired,less productive and grumpy.Sleep is the time when our bodies and minds are rested and resoted.

There are tow types of sleep: Rapid Eye Movement and Non-REM.We need both types to be healthy.Rapid Eye Movement sleep is when we drea,.Our brains are active, and our eyes have fast short movements,as if watching something.This type of sleep helps restore our mind.

Non-REM sleep is when our brain and body slow down.Our heart rate slows and our breathing is regular.THis type of sleep helps restore our body.We have twice as much Non-REM sleep as Rapid Eye Movement sleep each night.TO get better sleep,have a regular time for sleeping adn a routine before you go to bed.

This will give your body the signal that is is time to sleep.Make sure the bed and bedroom are quiet and comforable.If your bed is too hard or too soft,if you are too cold or too hot,you will not sleep well.For two hours before going to bed do not drink coffee or alcohol, or do not smoke or exercise.All these activities stimulate your body and make sleep difficult.

# Swimming 

Swimming is a competitive sport played around the world and on many different levels, including the Olympics.It's also an easy sport to do on your own,both for fun and for exercise.Many doctors and athletes agree that swimming is one of the best workouts you can give your body,because it works almost on all of your major muscle groups at the same time.

Since you're floating in the water and not in contact with any hard surfaces,there's less pressuce on your joints and bones.You're less likely to suffer injuries than with other sports

There are many way to push yourself and get better as a swimmer.If you're into speed, you can race the clock and see how long it takes you to do a certain number of laps.If you're into endurance,you can slow down and see how many laps you can do before you have to take a rest.

Many teenagers like swimming best.One of the students says,"The best part about swimming is when you beat your time.It doesn't even matter if you lose the race as long as you tried your best;you can walk away with a smile on your face.Ehen you're in the water you forget that people may be watching and all you care about is getting to the other side of the pool and touching the wall.You can just let go and fly."

# Dragon Boat Festival

The Dragon Boat Festival is on of three major Chinese holidays,along with the Spring and Moon Festiveals.Of the three,it is possibly the oldest,dating back to the Warring States Period in 227 B.C. The festival commemorates Qu Yuan, a minister in the servifce of the Chu Emperor.

Desparing over corruption at court,Qu threw himself into a river.Townspeople jumped into their boats and tried in vain to save him.Then hoping to distract hungry fish from his body,the people scattered rice on the water.

Over the years, the story of Qu's demise transformed into the traditions of racing dragon boats and eating zongzi-a kind of rice wrapped in bamboo leaves.The races have certainly captured the imagination of people from all over the world.

Every spring there are nearly 60 dragon boat races held outside of China in cities from Vancouver to Sydney.Canada alone has nearly 50 dragon boat teams and Germany has nearly 30.

So what is it about the Dragon Boat Festival that appeals to foreigners? "It's an unusual sport," says one racer from Germany."It's not like everybody's doing it.That's one of the reasons that there's such great team spirit in a dragon boat team-everybody feels like we're doing something special." And waht about the zongzi? "ehhh, they're not bad,I guess," he says. "Something of an acquired taste.I just haven't really acquired it yet"


# The Government of the United States

These days, the Amreican President is one of the most powerful men in the world.He can make war, or peace.He can touch the lives of millions in many differemt countries,but the President cannot do just what he wants.The Congress must agree first.

In some ways,the United States is like fifty small countires and not one large one.Every staet has its own governor,its own pilice,and its own laws.For example,in some states u cna buy an alcholic drink when you are 18.In others,you must wait until you are 21.

The government of the whole country (the 'federal' government)works from Washington, the capital city.This is where Congress is based.Congress has two parts,the Senate,and the House of Representatives.

There are 100 members of the Senate(called Senators),two from each state.The President cannot act without the Senate's
agreement.The House of Representatives has 435members.Like the senators,they can make new laws.

Americans choose a new President every four years.The election is a great occasion.It is serious business,of course,but the Americans make sure that it is fun too.

In the years after World War II, the world greatly changed.Much of this was due to new technology.For instance,the jet was developed.This increased the speed that people could travel.There were also advances in telecommunications.Computers and the Internet were invented.It became much easier for people to communicate with others all around the world.This has led to the spread of globalization.

Basically,the world is becoming a smaller palce.In the past,what happende in one country rarely affected other countries.Or it took a long time for any effects to occur.But the world is different today.
Because of globalization, what happens in one part of the world can affect places all around it.

Thanks to gloablization,people can now do business more easily with those in other countries.When you go to the supermarket,you can see various foods from all of the different countries. This happens because because of globalization.Also,people are learning more about other countries these days. This leads to more understanding about other countries.In the age of globalization,there has not been a single world war.And the world is becoming richer.Globalization has surely been good for the world.

If you want to run a company well,you should remember that there are four general policies to follow with employees.

First,pay them what they are worth.When people begin with your company, they are rarely worth what they are paid,because you are investing in their future productivity.you should pay people low at the start,with higher payments once they are established and productive.

Second, you should make employees feels important.Build them positively and openly when praise is deserved.Timeper this with negative motivation,pointing out where minor shortcomings are diluting the success that could be enjoyed.Avoid complacency by keeping employees slightly off-balance.

Third,make employees think for themselves.Sometimes by being nonspecific, you create the environment whiere employees adapt other ideas and learn how to apply them in the new situation.

Fourth,separate office life from social life.It is impossible to let your hair down with someone one night,and com down hard on them the next day.

You should also remember that if you have to fire employees,take a creative approach.Try to find a job for them somewhere else, and let the other company steal them away,However ,if extreme action if called fro,act decisively while respecting the feeling of the employee.

Never expect from your employees anything that you are not willing to do yourself.It's more than a cliche-it's sound business practice.

# passage 15: Importance of communication

Communication is extremely important in any relationship.Importance of COmmunication has been stressed time and again.lack of communication creates a number of problems that only increase with time.

It is often seen that hte families where people talk to each other frequently are happier.They share their joys,sorrows and other emotions with each other.There is a lively atmosphoere in such families.They laugh it out together and celebrate every moment whole-heartedly.Such is the importantce of communication.

Compared to this,the families where all the members are busy with their own tasks are usually not as happy.The atmosphere in such families is quite dull and gloomy.They plan outings with their friends and colleagues rather than their family members.

This is becasoue they have neglected the importance of communication all along and are thus not comfortable communicationg with each other.And without good communication there is no way one can enjoy. People in such families often find themselves lonely and evne get int depression.

Similarly,lack of communication is harmful in every situation.We must all realise the importance of communication.

# passage 16: The Dangers of Plastic Bags

According to the latest report, nearly 200 differnent species of sea life including whales,dolphins,seals,and turtles die becasuse of plastic bags.

Bags end up in landfills,oceans,seas,and lakes.

Unlike items that naturally biodegrade,plastic bags photedegrade,meaning that over time the plastic breaks down into smaller,more toxic substances.These contaminants posion our soil and water and then enter our food chain.

If we trade our plastic bags for reusable cloth bags,we can help this plastic bag crisis

1.Because plastic bags are made form oil,reducing them would decrease foreign oil dependency.
2.we'd start preserving the thousands of marine animals and more than 1 million of birds whi die from plastic bags each year.

It's a small investment to give ourselves and our children a better futrue.

# passage 18: Parents and teenagers

Parents feel that it is difficult to live with teenagers.Teenagers have similar feelings about their parents,saying that it is not easy living with them.Accordingto a recent research, the most common argument between aparents and teenageers is that regarding untidiness and daily routine tasks.

On the one hand,parents go mad over messy rooms, clothes thrown on the floor and their children's refusal to help with the housework.

On the other hand, teenagers lose their patience continually when parents blame them for dropping the towel in the bathroom, not cleaning up their room or refusing to do the shopping at the supermarket.

Psychologists say that communication is the most important thing in parent-child relationships.Parents should talk to their children but at the same time they should lend an ear to what they have to say.

Parents may scold their children when they are untidy but they should also understand that their room is their own private space.Communication is a two-way process.It is only by listening to and understanding each otehr that problems
between parents and childeren can be settled.
